W3 TOTAL CACHE PLUGIN REVIEW:

Today !

While setting up the woocommerce setup on wordpress. one of the lugin crashed my site.
I found that plugin to be  "W3 TOTAL CACHE".
Initially, it was not making tany trouble.
But once I enable variuos options in its control panels like minify and some other performance paramters, it resulted in improper site and broke the front-end of site.
Later on R&D I also found , this plugin has some major bugs from Security point of you.
So, I Disabled all options in Plugin and Cleared All Caches by  "Empty All Cache" option from this plugin which resulted in Normal Working of that Site.

So, one Thing Learned, "the Plugin which make changes to the core files of platform should be tested and Learned Before putting it on Production.
And Performance of site increases drastically by scalling its base Servers which serve the Same site in Sufficient Bandwidths and its possible via CLOUD of AMAZON.

However before that, we would also try SUPER CACHE PLUGIN to see its pros and cons.
